                    <p class="p1home">Hi, my name is Savannah. I am a junior at the University of Michigan in the School of Information. I am getting a Bachelor of Science in Information with a minor in Entrepreneurship. I am specifically studying user experience design which has allowed me to build on my knowledge and skills in designing, building, and evaluating compelling interactive systems. I am passionate about creating products and experiences that are transformative for users.</p>
                    <p class="p2home">I have a passion for art and music as well. I love creating and refining user-centered designs for platforms specifically in those fields. I have prior experience working with figma and canva. I have used those softwares to create UX analyses of platforms, such as Spotify and Periscope, that reveal ways those systems can better optimize their user experience.</p>
                    <p class="p3home">I have always wanted to utilize my designs and create something with them. I have implemented my designs in rugs, in phone cases, and in posters that can be placed in picture frames. I have also used my designs on vinyl records and cases for the records.</p>
